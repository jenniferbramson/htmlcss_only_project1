		<h4 class="blogh">Fake Travel Picture Scheme</h4>
		<p class="blogp">You know when people post photos of food or travel views excessively to the point it is just annoying? I get it; they are excited. Who wouldn't be? Even the pictures make me insanely jealous. So, to get even with these people "showing off," my cousin Lindsay and I took fake travel photos the other day.</p>

		<p class="blogp">Wow. I am still sweating from walking across the desert to reach the Great Pyramids. What a trek.<p>

		<p class="blogp">Did I mention I met the queen the other day?</p>

		<h4 class="blogh">Family Murder Mystery Dinner</h4>
		<br></br>
		<img src="images/DSC_0223.JPG"/>
		<p class="blogp">A couple months ago, my family decided to celebrate my grandpa's birthday with a Roman murder mystery dinner. He was born and Italy and is obsessed with Augustus Caesar, so a Roman theme seemed perfect. Each person was given a sheet of paper explaining their character and all they knew a couple days beforehand. We arrived dressed in togas, adorned with props, and carrying Roman imitation food. We did not know who would be murdered - until the lights flickered off and my cousin Matt fell to the ground. We each started with some Roman coins. I was a Roman weapons and potions dealer and interchangeably spread rumors and kept my knowledge private in exchange for coin. Babies were born, secret lineage was revealed, coins were stolen, and weapons were broken, until only one of us suspected the murderer: Lindsay.</p>
